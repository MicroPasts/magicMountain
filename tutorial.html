                <p>
                    This project requires your help to capture the data held within the PDF scans. It is a very
                    straightforward tabulation exercise. DMNS would like your help to transcribe the following fields:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cat No. (Catalogue Number)</li>
                    <li> North (The excavation units are named by their northing and easting. For example, 304N/306E)
                    </li>
                    <li>East</li>
                    <li>L (Level)</li>
                    <li>Depth (lowest depth of level)</li>
                    <li>FS No. (Field Specimen Number)</li>
                    <li>S No. (Specimen Number)</li>
                    <li>Description</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 2 of the tutorial -->
            <div id="1" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    On the catalogue forms, the " (or ditto mark) means that the information in this box is the same as
                    the information from the box directly above the ".
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Please enter the number or descriptive information from above and not the ".</strong>
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 2 of the tutorial -->
            <div id="2" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    The catalogue entry will have either a FS or S number, not both. FS numbers were assigned to
                    artifacts found in each level of excavation in the field. S numbers were assigned to bulk soil
                    samples that were later wet screened.</p>
                <p>
                    When artifacts were found during the wet screening a S number was assigned.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 2 of the tutorial -->
            <div id="3" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> At the end of the field season all the artifacts with FS and S numbers were
                    renumbered with a catalogue number. This new catalogue number does not appear on the field
                    excavation
                    forms. By digitally compiling the information on these site catalogue forms, we will be able to
                    link the artifacts listed on the excavation forms with the appropriate catalogue numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, the excavation forms and field photographs from each level, as well as the photographs
                    of the artifacts found in each level will be available online for people to perform research on the
                    collection.
